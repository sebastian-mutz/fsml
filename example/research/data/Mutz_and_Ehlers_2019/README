Contents Description: (see more details in file header)
=====================
The file contains long term means of several variables derived from an ECHAM5 palaeoclimate simulation. Details about the type of means and simulations are given in the file name (see explanation below). For information about the simulation setup and boundary conditions, we refer the user to the Mutz et al. (2018) publication. For details about the construction of contained variables, we refer the reader to the Mutz and Ehlers (2019) publication. The variables included in this data package are:
- csfd: consecutive freezing days (days)
- fthd: freeze thaw days (days)
- cswd: consecutive wet days (days)
- csdd: consecutive dry days (days)
- t2am: 2m air temperature amplitude (°C)
- tsam: surface temperature amplitude (°C)
- pamp: precipitation amplitude (mm/day)
- pmax: maximum daily precipitation (mm/day)
