project: FSML
summary: FSML (Fortran Statistics and Machine Learning) is a scientific toolkit for statistics and machine learning - from basic correlation and statistical hypothesis testing to random forests regression and clustering. It written in modern Fortran (2008+) and offered as an [FPM](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) package for easy integration into your projects. The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastian-mutz/fsml) and released under the [MIT licence](./page/licence.html).

# <span style="color:#734f96">Description</span>

`FSML` (Fortran Statistics and Machine Learning) is a scientific toolkit consisting of common statistical and machine learning procedures, including basic descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, variance, correlation), common statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Mannâ€“Whitney U), linear parametric methods and models (e.g., multiple OLS regression, discriminant analysis), and non-linear statistical and machine learning procedures (e.g., k-means clustering).

**Key features:**

 - Common statistics and machine learning techniques (as used in modern research).
 - Familiar/intuitive interface (similarities to popular Python or R libs).
 - Core procedures are kept pure (to simplify parallelisation and testing), while impure wrappers handle optional arguments and errors for safe conventional use.
 - Minimal requirements/dependencies (Fortran 2008 or later, and stdlib).

The [FSML Handbook](./page/index.html). includes a short tutorial, detailed API documentation, as well as information for contributors and licence (MIT) details. The documentation pages were generated by [FORD](https://forddocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

### Aims and Scope

The aim is to create an easy-to-use library for modern Fortran applications that covers many statistics and machine learning procedures that are commonly used in research.

### Background

`FSML` started as an effort to rewrite, re-structure, clean-up, and enhance old Fortran code I've written in the past 15 years, and to bundle and publish it as a well organised and well documented library.

The published research below uses some of the to-be-reworked code and demonstrates some applications of the above-mentioned methods:

- [Mutz and Ehlers (2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-7-663-2019) (k-means and hierarchical clustering, and discriminant analysis).
- [Mutz et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2663-5) (multiple regression in cross validation and bootstrap setting, principal component analysis, and Bayesian classifier).

### Progress

Currently covered are procedures for sample statistics (STS), statistical distributions (DST) and statistical tests (TST). See the full list [here](./page/api/index.html#coverage). Additionally planned are procedures that rely heavily on linear algebra (e.g., PCA), nonlinear algorithmic procedures (e.g., k-means clustering), and machine learning framework extensions (e.g., cross-validation).

### Alpha

I will consider the library to be in "alpha" once `FSML` covers all of the originally planned functionality.

### Beta

This stage is reached once `FSML`:

- has undergone substantial testing (incl. comparisons to other libs).
- has proper documentation.
- fully works with GFortran and LFortran compilers.

@warning
FSML is in a pre-alpha state. Existing procedures and API may change significantly.
