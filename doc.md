project: FSML
summary: FSML (Fortran Statistics and Machine Learning) is a scientific toolkit for statistics and machine learning - from basic correlation and statistical hypothesis testing to different multivariate regression and clustering procedures. It is written in modern Fortran (2008+) and offered as an [FPM](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/) package for easy integration into your projects. The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastian-mutz/fsml) and released under the [MIT licence](./page/licence.html).

# Description

`FSML` (Fortran Statistics and Machine Learning) is a scientific toolkit consisting of common statistical and machine learning procedures, including basic statistics (e.g., mean, variance, correlation), common statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Mann–Whitney U), linear parametric methods and models (e.g., multiple OLS regression, discriminant analysis), and non-linear statistical and machine learning procedures (e.g., k-means clustering).

## Key features

 - Common statistics and machine learning techniques (as used in modern research).
 - Familiar/intuitive interface (similarities to popular Python or R libs).
 - Core procedures are kept pure (to simplify parallelisation and testing), while impure wrappers handle optional arguments and errors for safe conventional use.
 - Minimal requirements/dependencies (Fortran 2008 or later, and stdlib).

## Modules

FSML has five thematic modules: Basic statistics (STS), hypothesis tests (TST), linear procedures (LIN), non-linear procedures (NLP), and statistical distribution functions (DST).

# Handbook

The [FSML Handbook](http://fsml.mutz.science/page/index.html). includes a short tutorial, detailed API documentation, as well as information for contributors and licence (MIT) details. The documentation pages were generated by [FORD](https://forddocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

# Development

### Aims and Scope

The aim is to create an easy-to-use library for modern Fortran applications that covers many statistics and machine learning procedures that are commonly used in research.

### Background

`FSML` started as an effort to rewrite, re-structure, clean-up, and enhance old Fortran code I've written in the past 15 years, and to bundle and publish it as a well organised and well documented library.

The published research below uses some of the to-be-reworked code and demonstrates some applications of the above-mentioned methods:

- [Mutz and Ehlers (2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-7-663-2019) (k-means and hierarchical clustering, and discriminant analysis).
- [Mutz et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2663-5) (multiple regression in cross validation and bootstrap setting, principal component analysis, and Bayesian classifier).

### Progress

Currently covered are procedures for basic statistics (STS), statistical distributions (DST), statistical tests (TST), procedures that rely heavily on linear algebra (LIN), and non-linear algorithmic procedures (NLP). See the full list [here](http://fsml.mutz.science/page/api/index.html). Additionally planned are machine learning framework extensions (e.g., cross-validation) and further additions to the NLP module.
