![logo](media/logo/FSML_small.png)

`FSML` (Fortran Statistics and Machine Learning) is a scientific toolkit consisting of common statistical and machine learning procedures, including basic descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, variance, correlation), common statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Mannâ€“Whitney U), linear parametric methods and models (e.g., multiple OLS regression, discriminant analysis), and non-linear statistical and machine learning procedures (e.g., k-means clustering).

**Key features:**

 - Common statistics and machine learning techniques (as used in modern research).
 - Familiar/intuitive interface (similarities to popular Python or R libs).
 - Core procedures are kept pure (to simplify parallelisation and testing), while impure wrappers handle optional arguments and errors for safe conventional use.
 - Minimal requirements/dependencies (Fortran 2008 or later, and stdlib).

**Note:**
`FSML` uses double precision (real64) by default, but can be switched project-wide by changing the working precision (wp) in the `fsml_ini` module. The data type in your `FSML` application should match this.

### Aims and Scope

The aim is to create an easy-to-use library for modern Fortran applications that covers many statistics and machine learning procedures that are commonly used in research.

### Background

FSML started as an effort to rewrite, re-structure, clean-up, and enhance old Fortran code I've written in the past 15 years, and to bundle and publish it as a well organised and well documented library.

The published research below uses some of the to-be-reworked code and demonstrates some applications of the above-mentioned methods:

- [Mutz and Ehlers (2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-7-663-2019) (k-means and hierarchical clustering, and discriminant analysis).
- [Mutz et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2663-5) (multiple regression in cross validation and bootstrap setting, principal component analysis, and Bayesian classifier).

### Progress

Currently covered are procedures for sample statistics (STS), statistical distributions (DST) and statistical tests (TST). See the full list [here](./page/api/index.html#coverage). Additionally planned are procedures that rely heavily on linear algebra (e.g., PCA), nonlinear algorithmic procedures (e.g., k-means clustering), and machine learning framework extensions (e.g., cross-validation).

### Alpha

I will consider the library to be in "alpha" once FSML covers all of the functionality outlined below.

### Beta

This stage is reached once FSML:

- has undergone substantial testing (incl. comparisons to other libs).
- has proper documentation.
- fully works with GFortran and LFortran compilers.

### Reading and Basic Statistics

The example below loads data from a CSV file directly into a simple Fortran dataframe using *fsml_read_csv*, then uses procedures from the sample statistics module.

```fortran
program fsml_statistics
  use fsml
  use iso_fortran_env, dp => real64
  implicit none

  type(fsml_typ_df)  :: df     ! use fsml dataframe
  character(len=128) :: infile

  infile = "./example/data/DMC_Mutz2021_Antofagasta.csv"

  call fsml_read_csv(infile, df, labelcol=.true., labelrow=.true., delimiter=",")

  ! mean of first variable (msl - mean sea level pressure)
  print*, "mean: ", fsml_mean(df%data(:,1))

   ! correlation of msl and t2m
  print*, "pearson correlation coefficent: ", fsml_pcc(df%data(:,1), df%data(:,2))

end program fsml_statistics
```

### Statistical Distribution Functions

The example below demonstrates the use of pdf (probability density function), cdf (cumulative distribution function), and ppf (percent point function/quantile function) procedures for different statistical distributions.

```fortran
program fsml_distributions
  use fsml
  use iso_fortran_env, dp => real64
  implicit none

  ! exponential pdf (x=0.8)
  print*, fsml_exp_pdf(0.8_dp)

  ! left-tailed p-value for normal distribution with specified mean and standard deviation
  print*, fsml_norm_cdf(2.0_dp, mu=0.3_dp, sigma=1.3_dp, tail="left")

  ! genrealised pareto distribution cdf
  print*, fsml_gpd_cdf(1.9_dp, xi=1.2_dp, mu=0.6_dp, sigma=2.2_dp, tail="left")

  ! chi square distribution ppf
  print*, fsml_chi2_ppf(0.2_dp, df=10, loc=2.0_dp, scale=1.2_dp)

end program fsml_distributions
```

### Statistical Tests

In the example below, we create 2 data vectors and conduct statistical tests.

```fortran
program fsml_tests
  use fsml
  use iso_fortran_env, wp => real64
  implicit none

  integer , parameter :: n1 = 10, n2 = 13
  real(wp), parameter :: mu = 1.25_wp
  real(wp), parameter :: x1(n1) = [1.10_wp, 1.02_wp, 1.12_wp, 2.01_wp, 1.92_wp, 1.01_wp, 1.10_wp, 1.26_wp, 1.51_wp, 1.01_wp]
  real(wp), parameter :: x2(n2) = [2.10_wp, 1.02_wp, 1.22_wp, 1.05_wp, 0.95_wp, 1.02_wp, 2.00_wp, 1.05_wp, 1.12_wp, 1.20_wp, 1.12_wp, 1.01_wp, 1.12_wp]
  real(wp)            :: t, p, df

  ! 1-sample t-test
  call fsml_ttest_1sample(x1, mu, t, df, p, h1="two")
  write(*,'(A,F10.4)')   "  test statistic (t): ", t
  write(*,'(A,F10.4)')   "  degrees of freedom: ", df
  write(*,'(A,F10.4)')   "  p-value:            ", p
  ! test statistic (t):     0.4672
  ! degrees of freedom:     9.0000
  ! p-value:                0.6514

  ! 2-sample Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U rank sum test
  call fsml_ranksum(x1, x2, t, p, h1="two")
  write(*,'(A)') "> Mann-Whitney U rank sum test"
  write(*,'(A,F10.4)')   "  test statistic (U): ", t
  write(*,'(A,F10.4)')   "  p-value:            ", p
  ! test statistic (U):    59.5000
  ! p-value:                0.7330

end program fsml_tests
```
