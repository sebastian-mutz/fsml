Welcome to the guide to public-facing interfaces of FSML!

# <span style="color:#734f96">Structure</span>

The FSML procedures are categorised into several thematic modules:

- `STS`: Basic (sample) statistics (e.g., mean, variance)
- `DST`: Statistical distributions (e.g., Student's t distribution)
- `TST`: Statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., ANOVA)
- `LIN`: "Linear" statistical procedures; those relying heavily on linear algebra (e.g., PCA, OLS regression)
- `NLP`: Nonlinear and algorithmic procedures (e.g., k-means clustering)

While the public interfaces do not include these as prefixes, the handbook makes use of these categories to give it more structure.
If you are interested in exploring the code, you will recognise these in module and procedure names.
