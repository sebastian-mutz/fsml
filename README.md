## Description

![logo](doc/media/logo/FSML_small.png)



`FSML` (Fortran Statistics and Machine Learning) is a scientific toolkit consisting of common statistical and machine learning procedures, including basic descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, variance, correlation), common statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Mann–Whitney U), linear parametric methods and models (e.g., multiple OLS regression, discriminant analysis), and non-linear statistical and machine learning procedures (e.g., k-means clustering).

**Key features:**

 - Common statistics and machine learning techniques (as used in modern research).
 - Familiar/intuitive interface (similarities to popular Python or R libs).
 - Core procedures are kept pure (to simplify parallelisation and testing), while impure wrappers handle optional arguments and errors for safe conventional use.
 - Minimal requirements/dependencies (Fortran 2008 or later, and stdlib).

# Handbook

The [FSML Handbook](http://fsml.mutz.science/page/index.html). includes a short tutorial, detailed API documentation, as well as information for contributors and licence (MIT) details. The documentation pages were generated by [FORD](https://forddocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

# Development

### Aims and Scope

The aim is to create an easy-to-use library for modern Fortran applications that covers many statistics and machine learning procedures that are commonly used in research.

### Background

`FSML` started as an effort to rewrite, re-structure, clean-up, and enhance old Fortran code I've written in the past 15 years, and to bundle and publish it as a well organised and well documented library.

The published research below uses some of the to-be-reworked code and demonstrates some applications of the above-mentioned methods:

- [Mutz and Ehlers (2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-7-663-2019) (k-means and hierarchical clustering, and discriminant analysis).
- [Mutz et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2663-5) (multiple regression in cross validation and bootstrap setting, principal component analysis, and Bayesian classifier).

### Progress

Currently covered are procedures for sample statistics (STS), statistical distributions (DST) and statistical tests (TST). See the full list [here](http://fsml.mutz.science/page/api/index.html). Additionally planned are procedures that rely heavily on linear algebra (e.g., PCA), nonlinear algorithmic procedures (e.g., k-means clustering), and machine learning framework extensions (e.g., cross-validation).

### Alpha

I will consider the library to be in "alpha" once `FSML` covers all of the originally planned functionality.

### Beta

This stage is reached once `FSML`:

- has undergone substantial testing (incl. comparisons to other libs).
- has proper documentation.
- fully works with GFortran and LFortran compilers.
