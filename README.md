## <span style="color:#734f96">Description</span>

![logo](assets/logo/FSML_small.png)

FSML is a scientific toolkit consisting of common statistical and machine learning procedures, including basic statistics (e.g., mean, variance, correlation), common statistical tests (e.g., t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov), linear parametric methods and models (e.g., principal component analysis, discriminant analysis, Bayesian classifier), and non-linear statistical and machine learning procedures (e.g., k-means clustering).

**Key features:**

 - Common statistics and machine learning techniques (as used in modern research).
 - Familiar/intuitive interface (similarities to popular Python or R libs).
 - Compromise between performance and readability (also suitable for demonstration, teaching, and tinkering).
 - Minimal requirements/dependencies (Fortran 2008 or later, and stdlib).


## <span style="color:#734f96">Example</span>

The example below loads data from a CSV file directly into a simple Fortran dataframe using *fsml_readcsv*. The file stores data for different variables in separate columns. *fsml_mean* and *fsml_var* calculate the mean and variance of a passed vector, respectively. *fsml_corr* computes the Pearson correlation coefficient from the vectors of column 1 and 2.

```fortran
program fortran_statistics
  use fsml
  use iso_fortran_env, dp => real64
  implicit none

  type(fsml_typ_df)  :: df
  character(len=128) :: infile

  infile = "./example/data/DMC_Mutz2021_Antofagasta.csv"

  call fsml_read_csv(infile, df, labelcol=.true., labelrow=.true., delimiter=",")

  ! mean of first variable (msl - mean sea level pressure)
  print*, "mean: ", fsml_mean(df%data(:,1))

  ! variance of second variable (t2m - 2m air temperature)
  print*, "variance: ", fsml_var(df%data(:,2))

  ! correlation of msl and t2m
  print*, "correlation coefficent: ", fsml_corr(df%data(:,1), df%data(:,2))

  ! exponential pdf (x=0.8)
  print*, fsml_exp_pdf(0.8_dp)

  ! left-tailed p-value for normal distribution with specified mean and standard deviation
  print*, fsml_norm_cdf(2.0_dp, mu=0.3_dp, sigma=1.3_dp, tail="left")

  ! left-tailed p-value for t distribution with specified degrees of freedom
  print*, fsml_t_ppf(0.9_dp, df=20, mu=0.2_dp, sigma=1.2_dp)

  ! genrealised pareto distribution cdf
  print*, fsml_gpd_cdf(1.9_dp, xi=1.2_dp, mu=0.6_dp, sigma=2.2_dp, tail="left")

  ! gamma distribution pdf
  print*, fsml_gamma_pdf(0.2_dp, alpha=1.2_dp, beta=0.6_dp, loc=0.0_dp)

  ! chi square distribution ppf
  print*, fsml_chi2_ppf(0.2_dp, df=10, loc=2.0_dp, scale=1.2_dp)

end program fortran_statistics
```


## <span style="color:#734f96">Development</span>

FSML is an effort to rewrite, re-structure, clean-up, and enhance old Fortran code I've written for my research in the past 15 years, and to bundle and publish it as a well organised and well documented library.

The published research below uses some of the to-be-reworked code and demonstrates some applications of the above-mentioned methods:

- [Mutz and Ehlers (2019)](https://doi.org/10.5194/esurf-7-663-2019) (k-means and hierarchical clustering, and discriminant analysis)
- [Mutz et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-015-2663-5) (multiple regression in cross validation and bootstrap setting, principal component analysis, and Bayesian classifier)

### <span style="color:#734f96">Alpha</span>

I will consider the library to be in "alpha" once FSML covers the functionality needed to reproduce ~80% of all the Fortran-based data analysis I've conducted (and published) in the past ~15 years.

### <span style="color:#734f96">Beta</span>

This stage is reached once:

- FSML is able to reproduce all of the above mentioned type of analyses without issues.
- FSML fully works with GFortran, LFortran, and Flang compilers.
- FSML has proper documentation.

### <span style="color:#734f96">Progress</span>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Uses double precision (real64) by default, but can be switched project-wide by changing working precision (wp) in the fsml_typ module.
