! ---- Statistical Tests

! 1 sample t-test
interface fsml_ttest_1sample
  !! The 1-sample t-test determines if the sample mean has the value specified in the null hypothesis.
  !!
  !! The null hypothesis \( H_{0} \) and alternative hypothesis \( H_{1} \) can be written as:
  !! \( H_{0} \): \( \bar{x}  =  \mu_0 \), and \( H_{1} \): \( \bar{x} \neq \mu_0 \)
  !!
  !! The test statstic \( t \) is calculated as follows:
  !! $$ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}$$
  !! where \( \bar{x} \) is the sample mean,
  !! \( s \) is the sample standard deviation,
  !! \( n \) is the sample size, and
  !! \( \mu_0 \) is the population mean.
  !!
  !! The degrees of freedom \( \nu \) is calculated as follows:
  !! $$ \nu = n -1 $$
  module procedure s_tst_ttest_1s
end interface

! paired sample t-test
interface fsml_ttest_paired
  !! The paired sample t-test (or  dependent sample t-test) determines if
  !! the mean difference between two sample sets are zero.
  !! It is mathematically equivalent to the 1-sample t-test conducted
  !! on the difference vector \( d \) with \( \mu_0 = 0 \).
  !!
  !! The null hypothesis \( H_{0} \) and alternative hypothesis \( H_{1} \) can be written as:
  !! \( H_{0} \): \( \bar{d}  =  0 \), and \( H_{1} \): \( \bar{d} \neq 0 \)
  !!
  !! The test statstic \( t \) is calculated as follows:
  !! $$ t = \frac{\bar{d} - 0}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}$$
  !! where \( \bar{d} \) is the mean of the differences between the sample sets,
  !! \( s_d \) is the standard deviation of the differences, and
  !! \( n \) is the number of paired samples.
  !!
  !! The degrees of freedom \( \nu \) is calculated as follows:
  !! $$ \nu = n -1 $$
  module procedure s_tst_ttest_paired
end interface

! 2 sample t-test
interface fsml_ttest_2sample
  !! The 2-sample t-test determines if two population means \( \mu_1 \) and \( \mu_2\) are the same.
  !! The procedure can handle 2-sample t-tests for equal variances and Welch's t-tests for unequal variances.
  !!
  !! The null hypothesis \( H_{0} \) and alternative hypothesis \( H_{1} \) can be written as:
  !! \( H_{0} \): \( \mu_1 \ = \mu_2 \), and \( H_{1} \): \( \mu_1 \ \neq \mu_2\)
  !!
  !! The procedure defaults to Welch's t-test for unequal variances if `eq_var` is not specified.
  !! In this case, the test statstic \( t \) is calculated as follows:
  !! $$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2} }} $$
  !! where \( \bar{x}_1 \) and \( \bar{x}_2 \) are the sample means
  !! \( s^2_1 \) and \( s^2_2 \) are the sample standard deviations, and
  !! \( n_1 \) and \( n_1 \) are the sample sizes.
  !! The degrees of freedom \( \nu \) is approximated with the Welch–Satterthwaite equation:
  !! $$ \nu = \frac{\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2} {\frac{\left( \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} \right)^2}{n_1 - 1} + \frac{\left( \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} \right)^2}{n_2 - 1}} $$
  !!
  !! If variances are assumed to be equal (`eq_var = .true.`),
  !! the procedure conducts a 2 sample t-test for equal variances, using the pooled standard
  !! deviation \( s_p \) to calculate the t-statistic:
  !! $$ t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}} $$
  !!
  !! In case of assumed equal variances, the degrees of freedom is calculated as follows:
  !! $$ \nu = n_1 + n_2 - 2 $$
  module procedure s_tst_ttest_2s
end interface

! 1-way ANOVA
interface fsml_anova_1way
  !! The one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests whether three or more population means
  !! \( \mu_1, \mu_2, \dots, \mu_k \) are equal.
  !!
  !! The null hypothesis \( H_0 \) and alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \) are defined as:
  !! \( H_0 \): \( \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_k \), and
  !! \( H_1 \): At least one \( \mu_j \) differs from the others.
  !!
  !! The data is passed to the procedure as a rank-2 array `x`, where each column is a group of observations.
  !! The procedure partitions then the total variability in the data (  \( SS_{total} \) ) into
  !! variability between groups ( \( SS_{between} \); variability explained by groups ), and
  !! variability within groups ( \( SS_{within} \); unexplained or residual variability ), so that
  !! $$ SS_{total} =  SS_{between} + SS_{within} $$
  !!
  !! The F-statistic (`f`) is the ratio of the mean sum of squares between groups
  !! to the mean sum of squares within groups:
  !! $$ F = \frac{SS_{between} / (k - 1)}{SS_{within} / (n - k)} $$
  !! where \( k \) is the number of groups, \( n \) is the total number of observations,
  !! \( SS_{between} \) is the sum of squares between groups, and
  !! \( SS_{within} \) is the sum of squares within groups.
  !!
  !! The degrees of freedom are \( \nu_1 = k - 1 \) between groups (`df_b`)
  !! and \( \nu_2 = n - k \) within groups (`df_w`).
  !!
  !! The resulting p-value (`p`) is computed from the F-distribution:
  !! $$ p = P(F_{\nu_1, \nu_2} > F_{observed}) = 1 - \text{CDF}(F_{observed}) $$
  !!
  !! It is computed with the elemental procedure `f_dst_f_cdf_core`.
  !!
  !! The ANOVA makes the assumptions that
  !! a) the groups are independent,
  !! b) the observations within each group are normally distributed, and
  !! c) The variances within groups are equal.

! Wilcoxon 1-sample signed rank test
interface fsml_signedrank_1sample
  !! The 1-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test is a non-parametric test that
  !! determines if data comes from a symmetric population with centre \( mu_0 \).
  !! It can be regarded as a non-parametric version of the 1-sample t-test.
  !! The test statistic \( W \) is the smaller of the sum of positive and
  !! negative signed ranks:
  !! $$ W = \min \left( \sum_{d_i > 0} R_i, \sum_{d_i < 0} R_i \right) $$
  !!
  !!
  !! If the data consists of independent and similarly distributed samples
  !! from distribution \( D \), the null hypothesis \( H_0 \) can be expressed as:
  !!
  !! \( D \) is symmetric around \( \mu = \mu_0 \).
  !!

  !!
  !! If the alternative hypothesis is set to "less than" (`h1 = "lt"`), it is:

! Wilcoxon 2-sample (paired sample) signed rank test
interface fsml_signedrank_paired
  !! The Wilcoxon signed rank test is a non-parametric test that determines
  !! if two related paired samples come from the same distribution.
  !! It can be regarded as a non-parametric version of the paired t-test.
  !!
  !! The Wilcoxon signed rank test is mathematically equivalent to the
  !! 1-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test conducted on the difference vector
  !! \( d = x_1 - x_2 \) with \( mu_0 \) set to zero. Consequently, the
  !! the null hypothesis \( H_0 \)  can be expressed as:

  !! Samples \( x_1 - x_2 \) are symmetric around \( \mu = 0 \).
  !!
  !! The default alternative hypothesis \( H_1 \) is two-sided and also be
  !! set explicitly (`h1 = "two"`). It can be expressed as:
  !!
  !! Samples \( x_1 - x_2 \) are symmetric around \( \mu \neq 0 \)

  !!
  !! If the alternative hypothesis is set to "less than" (`h1 = "lt"`), it is:

! Wilcoxon rank-sum / Mann–Whitney U test
interface fsml_ranksum
  !! The ranks sum test (Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Mann–Whitney U test) is a
  !! non-parametric test to determine if two independent samples \( x_1 \) and
  !! \( x_2 \) are have the same distribution. It can be regarded as the non-parametric
  !! equivalent of the 2-sample t-test.
  !!
  !! The Mann–Whitney U statistic is calculated for each sample as follows:
  !! $$ U_i = R_i - \frac{n_i \cdot (n_i + 1)}{2} $$
  !! where \( R_i \) is the sum of ranks of sample set \( i \)
  !! and \( n_i \) is the sample size of sample set \( i \).
  !! The final U statistic is:
  !! $$ U = \min(U_1, U_2) $$
  !!
  !! The null hypothesis \( H_{0} \) and alternative hypothesis \( H_{1} \) can be written as:

  !! $$
  !! where:
  !! - \( n \) is the total number of observations,
  !! - \( k \) is the number of groups,
  !! - \( n_j \) is the number of observations in group \( j \), and
  !! - \( R_j \) is the sum of ranks in group \( j \).
  !!
  !! The degrees of freedom are:
  !! $$ \nu = k - 1 $$
  !! and returned as `df`.
  !!
  !! The p-value (`p`) is computed from the chi-squared distribution:
  !! $$ p = P(\chi^2_{\nu} > H_{observed}) = 1 - \text{CDF}(H_{observed}) $$
  !!
  !! It is computed using the elemental procedure `f_dst_chi2_cdf_core`.
  !!
  !! The Kruskal-Wallis test assumes that:
  !! a) all groups are independent,
  !! b) the response variable is ordinal or continuous,
  !! c) the group distributions have the same shape,
  !! and d) observations are independent both within and between groups.

! ---- Utilities

! ranks elements in an array
interface fsml_rank
  !! Ranks all samples such that the smallest value obtains rank 1
  !! and the largest rank n. Handles tied ranks and assigns average
  !! rank to tied elements within one group of tied elements.
